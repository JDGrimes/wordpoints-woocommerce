Hello! This is where we develop the premium WooCommerce integration extension that you can [purchase on WordPoints.org](https://wordpoints.org/extensions/woocommerce/). The source code of the extension is made available here in good faith, to make it easier for developers to integrate with it, contribute bugfixes and security patches, and follow the development of new features. You can also feel free to use this source code to try the extension out before you buy it. However, if you decide to use the extension on a production site, we ask that you [purchase a license for it](https://wordpoints.org/extensions/woocommerce/), so that we can continue to provide updates and support for WordPoints and all of its great extensions. Thank you!
